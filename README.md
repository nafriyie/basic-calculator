# Basic-Calculator
An object-oriented program in Java that allows you to perform the basic operations on a set of two numbers.

This program was the first project I did while initially learning how to code in my first year of college. I created this as a side project while I was trying the better understand Java. This program creates a BasicCalculator object when called in the main method. From there, you can choose to perform either multiplication, division, addition, or modulus on two numbers of your choice when you initialize the object. Creating this program gave me a better understanding of how mathematical operations work with different data types.
